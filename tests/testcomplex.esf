# the MetaEventInfo is a special single level of inheritance of events.  Any 
# fields in this Event are allowed in all other events.  Certain systems 
# will set these fields, so the SenderIP, SenderPort, and ReceiptTime are 
# set by all journallers and listeners, while the encoding is set by all 
# emitters.

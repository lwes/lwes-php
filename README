This is the PHP API for the Light Weight Event System.

It uses a PECL-compatible build system, so the simplest way
to compile and install this package is:

  1. ./bootstrap
  2. ./configure
  3. make
  4. make install

This will attempt to build and install the LWES extension into the
modules directory defined by "php-config".  Note that you must have
the LWES library installed first before you can install the PHP extension,
as well as have pkg-config setup to detect the location of the library.

You may need to edit the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable if your system has
trouble detecting the location of LWES.  Most commonly, the following
environment variable needs to be set before running the above steps:

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

So that pkg-config can pick up the .pc file needed to configure LWES.

However, if you are using a system install of LWES in /usr, usually
pkgconfig will pick up the .pc file in /usr/lib/pkgconfig, and no
manual intervention is necessary.
